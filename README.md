# AI
Two small Python programming assignments I worked on for an artificial intelligence class in college.

In "search", the files I edited are "search.py" and "searchAgents.py".
A description of this assignment can be found at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckroer/ai/search.html

In "classification", the files I edited are "perceptron_pacman.py", "perceptron.py", and "dataClassifier.py".
